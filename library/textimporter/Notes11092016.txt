you need to specify the value and desc like this:
    SELECT table.valueField AS 'value', table.descriptionField AS 'desc', table.otherFields

version = 2 for new customSelectFrom

sample customSelectFrom

select CONCAT(fe.date,'-',fe.encounter) as 'desc', tp.id  as 'value'
from form_encounter as fe inner join forms as f 
  on fe.encounter = f.encounter
 inner join form_treatment_plan as tp 
  on f.form_id = tp.id
where fe.pid = {pid}
  and f.form_name = 'treatment plan'
  and f.pid = {pid}
  and f.deleted = 0
  and tp.status = 'Ready for Billing/Supervisor'
  and fe.encounter <> {encounter}
Order by fe.date desc, tp.id desc
limit 10;
